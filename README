## Installing Python

You may already have python installed on your computer, you can check which version by opening a terminal and typing 

	python --version

You might see something like this:

> Python 2.7.10

There are two versions of python in active use, 2.7.x and 3.5.x, in generally most things work the same way between the two versions, but some things are different. For more information on the differences see: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3

As a group, it seems the consensus is to use python 3.5 and install using the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda makes it easy to manage your python environment. Follow the guide here to get set-up: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html

If you have trouble after installation it is likely an issue with the PATH setting for you shell, feel free to reach out on slack for help. 

## Using Git and Github

While git is not strictly required to learn python, its a helpful tool for managing your work without ending up with many scattered files as you experiment.
